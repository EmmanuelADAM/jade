## Circular economy

Here is a scenario:
 
 - some users have products
 - some products can be broken or become obsolescent 
 - several solutions exists:
   - tuto on website
   - repair coffees
   - spare parts stores
   - distributors.

- When the product doesn't work anymore; the user try to find a help : by itself, locally (repair coffee), in a larger 
region, and finally to the distributors.

- Solutions can exist on web, but the user can need a repair coffee to understand, to fix its product.

We can add these specification for a simple scenario : 
- there are type of products : mouse :computer_mouse:, screen :desktop_computer:,  coffeeMaker :coffee:, washingMachine :dress: :jeans:, dishwasher :plate_with_cutlery:,  vacuumCleaner :tornado:
- the price of each product is (= ± 15%): mouse  (30€), screen(150€),  coffeeMaker(50€), washingMachine(300€), dishwasher(300€),  vacuumCleaner(100€)
- a product have from 1 to 4 removable/fixable elements, we name them el1, el2,el3,el4.
- a breakdown is focused on 1 elt.
- a breakdown can be very light (0), easy(1), average (2), difficult(3), definitive (4)
  - this level of pb is detected during the reparation  
- a user has a skill for repairing,this skill can be of a level: 
  - 0 (unable to repair by itself and understand), 
  - 1 (can understand breakdown level up to 1, but only repair level 0),
  - 2 (can understand and repair breakdown level up to 2,
  - 3 (can understand and repair breakdown level up to 3,

- repair coffees have no items; they advise the user about the elt to find/buy
- spare parts stores have only 10 items of elt 1,2 or 3 and do not have elt4
- distributors have not pb of elt

- repair coffees have a cost of 5€/elt (the drink you buy)
- spare parts stores have a cost of 30€/elt
- spare parts stores specialised on second-hand material have a cost of 15€/elt
- for distributors the replacement is the price of the product (generated randomly from the specification)

- a user has a limited amount of money, and time. 
  - we suppose he/she chooses to go to repair coffees and if the reparation is impossible (no more time, enough money)  : 
    - he/she go the  higher level (a spare parts store)
    - or stop and let the elt of her/his product to the repair coffee..

- a user can have preference, and different level on confidence about the repair coffees, spare parts stores (less confidence in second hand product), distributors.

### Design
1. Define the agents and draw the diagrams (sequences diagram, use at least on activities diagram, or a state diagram to precise a part of your algorithm (ex. process of choice to repair to rebuy)) with Plant-UML 
to simulate the behaviour in several use cases you choose (ask for a repair, ....). **[8 points]**
    - elaborate all the different cases according to the description of this subject

2. Build some agents (2 users, 4 repair coffee, 3 part stores, 3 distributors) using the new Jade Library to simulate this behaviour.
   - Generate a random objects for the user agents and distributors, 
   - random parts for the spare part stores.
   - and random specialities in repair coffee.
   - propose some gui **[5 points]**
   - <span style="background-color:yellow">*(some examples are given, see the ``agents``, ``data`` and ``gui`` packages; launch the ``LauchSimu`` class)*</span>

3. A user agent launch a CFP to find the best appropriate repair coffee.
   -  a repair coffee:
        - can accept if the product correspond to one of its specialities
        - propose a date (from the current date + 1 to 3 days (see LocalDate from Java)
   - the user:
     - choose the repair coffee with the nearest date
   - THE repair coffee 
     - help the user to find which part to buy, *if it's repairable*. 
       - if it's not repairable, the user
           - launches a CFP to find a new product
           - and chooses according to the price and its confidence to 2nde hand product or not
   - the user:
     - decides if he/she prefers buy a new product (or a second-hand product) or repair the product.
     - if he/she wants to repair:
       - launches a CFP to find the appropriate part and choose
       - repairs by her/him self if he/she has capability
       - or asks for a rendez-vous to a repair coffee
     - if he/she wants to buy a new one, the user launch a CFP to the distributors

     **[7 points]**

We add a second criteria, the time:
- repair coffee have a cost of 3 days/elt (you have to plan a 'rendez-vous', they teach you how to repair, and they do not have elt, only tools)
- spare parts stores  have a cost of 2 day (they have the specific piece well adapt, 1 day to send, but you need 1 day to install it)
- distributors have a cost of 1 day (they simply exchange the object)
